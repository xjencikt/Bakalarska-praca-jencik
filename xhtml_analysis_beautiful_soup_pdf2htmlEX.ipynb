      "ALPHA QUEST FUNDS SICAV p.l.c.  3  Report of the Directors The directors present their report and the audited financial statements of Alpha Quest Funds SICAV p.l.c. (the “Company”), covering the financial year ended 31 December 2021. Incorporation and principal activities The Company was incorporated on 28 November 2016.  The Company is licensed and regulated by the Malta Financial Services Authority (“MFSA”) under the Investment Services Act (CAP. 370, Laws of Malta) as a Professional Investor Fund which targets Qualifying Investors as set out in the relevant Offering Supplement.  Review of business The licensed sub-funds as at the end of the year were as follows: - Alpha Quest Balanced Fund (PIF/430A); and - Alpha Quest Opportunity Fund (PIF/430 B).  During the year under review, there were no subscriptions and redemptions in Alpha Quest Balanced Fund and Alpha Quest Opportunity Fund. In 2020, subscriptions amounted to EUR Nil and redemptions amounted to EUR 12,439,236 in Alpha Quest Opportunity Fund. The Company continued to purchase Romanian restitution points and is currently one of the largest owners of these points on the Romanian market holding roughly 187 million points (2020: roughly 252 million points) (having nominal value of RON 1 per point) as at 31 December 2021. During the comparative year, the Company also issued on the Bratislava Stock Exchange an Unsecured Bond with maturity date on 15 December 2025 with a yield of 5% p.a. in the nominal value of EUR 40 million. At the reporting date, the subscribed for and paid up bonds from this issue amounted to EUR 40,000,000 (2020: EUR6,223,000).  During the current year, the Company’s previously issued bonds on the Prague Stock Exchange have matured and the Company issued a new unsecured Bond with maturity date on 22 June 2026 with a yield of 5.25% p.a. in the nominal value of CZK 200 million. At the reporting date, the subscribed for and paid up bonds from this issue amounted to CZK 200,000,000 (2020: CZK Nil) (refer to note 13 in the financial statements for further details).  Results The results for the year under review are shown in the statement of comprehensive income.  Dividends and reserves A dividend amounting to EUR 2,085,205 (2020: EUR 1,759,377) has been declared to the ‘A’ Class Shareholders during the year. The proposed dividends after year-end amounted to EUR 1,879,825. Retained earnings of the Company at end of year amounted to EUR 1,879,824 (2020: EUR 1,216,543).  Currency The financial statements are drawn up in Euro (€), which is the currency in which the Company's share capital is denominated, in terms of section 187 of the Companies Act, 1995.  Principal risks and uncertainties  The activities of the Company expose it to a variety of risks. The successful management of risk is essential to enable the Company  to achieve its objectives. The ultimate responsibility for risk management rests with the Company’s directors, who evaluate the Company’s risk appetite and formulate policies for identifying and managing such risks. The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Company are included below.  The Company defines risk as the probability of a permanent loss of capital. The risk management effort targets the minimization of the probability of a permanent loss of invested capital within its investment objective. At the same time, it is also understood that the risk cannot be completely eliminated. Risk is considered acceptable by the Board of Directors if its sources are understood and within appetite and tolerance levels set by the Board of Directors after consulting the Investment Committee. It is important to understand the sources of risk and carry risk only if there is adequate compensation in the form of return.  The Company carries the risk of losses due to non-compliance with legal requirements towards the Maltese regulator and other regulators in whose jurisdiction the Company may conduct its business, including those in which the Company has issued securities on recognised exchanges, or other potential institutions. \n",
      "ALPHA QUEST FUNDS SICAV p.l.c.  4  Report of the Directors (continued) Principal risks and uncertainties (continued) The internal compliance function of the Company is carried out by experienced personnel. The Company is subject to numerous laws and regulations covering a wide range of matters. Failure to comply could have financial or reputational implications and could materially affect the Company’s ability  to operate. The Company has embedded operating policies and procedures to ensure compliance with existing legislation.  The Company’s investments in the points awarded under indemnification decisions issued by the Romanian Government need to be sourced from individual beneficiaries of such points and acquired through public deeds registered in Romania. There is no guarantee that the Company will manage to source such points, or a particular number of points. The Company may also be exposed to changes in the Romanian Government’s interpretation of the points system and/or to changes in the applicable laws. Romania has undergone a long period of economic transition to a market economy, which has not been smooth. An extensive programme of economic reforms included the privatisation of several state-owned enterprises and the restructuring of Romania’s energy, mining and industrial sector. Externally, a slowdown in global trade may have a high impact on Romania’s growth, mainly due to its reliance on other EU economies as trading partners. Geopolitical tensions, combined with the increase in the US Federal Reserve’s key-interest rate could lead to increased investor caution, capital outflows and depreciation of the local currency (RON).  The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has not adversely affected the Company  in any way. The  Company operates on a going concern basis.  The exposure of the above risks, the way these risks arise, and how the Company manages these risks are further disclosed in detail in note 9 to these financial statements and in the Offering Documentation of the Company and the respective Sub-Fund.  Subsequent events Due to the outbreak of conflict between Russia and the Ukraine, followed by new sanctions announced by the U.S. and the EU countries against Russia, the Company has assessed the relevant risk factors relating to its business, results of operations and financial condition in a holistic approach. The Company has no business flows with Russian and Ukrainian counterparties and service providers nor with Russian banks and therefore, is not negatively affected as of the date of the approval of these financial statements.  There were no other subsequent events that could have a significant effect on the financial statements as at 31 December 2021.  In April 2022, the Company submitted an application to the Malta Financial Services Authority to convert its license into an Alternative Investment Fund. When this application is accepted, the Company will need to implement a number of structural changes needed to comply with the new license conditions.   \n",

      "ALPHA QUEST FUNDS SICAV p.l.c.  7  SPECIFIC DISCLOSURES  Information about the Issuer  The name of the Company is Alpha Quest Funds SICAV p.l.c. (the “Company”).  The registered office of the Company is situated at Quad Central, Q3 Level 9, Triq L-Esportaturi, Zone 1, Central Business District, Birkirkara CBD 1040, Malta..  The Company was incorporated on 28 November 2016. The Company is organised as a multi-fund limited liability investment company with variable share capital under the laws of the Republic of Malta and licensed by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) with Licence Number SV 430 under the Investment Services Act (Chapter 370 of the Laws of Malta) as a Professional Investor Fund targeting Qualifying Investors.  The Company may establish a number of Sub-funds. Currently the Company has established two Sub-funds: the Alpha Quest Balanced Fund and the Alpha Quest Opportunity Fund. Pursuant to Legal Notice 241 of 2006, the assets and liabilities of each individual Fund comprised in the Company shall constitute a patrimony separate from that of each other Sub-fund of the Company so that the assets of one Sub-fund shall be available exclusively for the creditors and holders of Shares in that Sub-fund.  LEI code:    213800JHGGP7KI184U67 ISIN:      CZ0000000856 Telephone:     (00356) 2258 4700 Fax:       (00356) 2258 4701  The Company is not part of any group and therefore, is not dependent upon any entities.   Principal activity and investments  The Company is an investment company with variable share capital, the sole object of which is the collective investment of its funds in securities and other movable or immovable property, or in any of them, with the aim of spreading investment risks and giving Members the benefits of the results of the management of its funds.  The investment objective of both Sub-funds is to achieve capital appreciation primarily through investments in restitution points representing entitlement to immovable property located in Romania with the purpose of redeeming the points so acquired into cash or re-selling the immovable property so acquired. Such investments are derived from indemnification decisions issued by the Romanian Government – National Authority for Property Restitution (“ANRP”) regarding the measures for the completion of the restitution process, in kind or in equivalent, of the properties unlawfully seized during the Romanian communist regime, as subsequently amended. The Romanian law provides that where restitution in kind to the former owners is not possible, the restitution request is settled by granting compensation in the form of points (hereinafter “Points”), with each point having a value of one Romanian Leu (RON 1). Starting from 1 January 2017, persons obtaining such points may use them in order to acquire immovable property from a National Fund by public auction or, for a period of five (5) years, to redeem them into cash up to a maximum of 20% of the nominal value of Points per annum. There is no time-limit for utilizing Points to acquire immovable property by public auction. The Points will be acquired on the secondary market from existing owners through a notarial deed executed and registered in Romania. If Points are redeemed at public auctions, the Sub-fund will not enter into any co-ownership deal and will only acquire individual properties in their entirety. No Points will be acquired from any of the members of the Investment Committee and/ or any related parties to the Company.\n",

Corporate governance and the Code  The Issuer has not voluntarily adopted the Corporate Governance Code prepared in 2018 by Czech Institute of Directors together with Deloitte and issued in 2019. This Code is available on the website of Czech Ministry of Finance www.mfcr.cz.   However, the Issuer’s Corporate Governance is organized in accordance with the principles outlined in this document, as defined in the internal policies and statutes of the Issuer. In addition to its own policies, the corporate governance is fully in line with applicable law.  The above mentioned code has not been voluntarily adopted  because in addition to the simple shareholder structure, the Issuer considers the existing policies  of the corporate governance fully adequate and functional.  Information about internal control principles and strategies and the rules for the treatment of risks  The Board of Directors is responsible for implementing adequate administrative and accounting procedures for the preparation of the financial statements. The Board of Directors has responsibility for the planning, management and monitoring of those processes relating, in particular, to management and accounting information flows (including the automated data processing and accounting reporting systems) and for attesting to their adequacy and effective application, as defined by the relevant laws and  regulations. The Company also established a position of a compliance officer ensuring the Company complies with its outside regulatory requirements and internal policies.  The Board of Directors identifies and assesses the risks on financial information, identifies and carries out the appropriate controls, targeted at mitigating the possibility that such risks will occur, and monitors and assesses the efficiency of the controls in relation to the financial information process. The Administrator calculates the Net Asset Value (“NAV”) of the Sub-funds as at the date of the statement of financial position or at the settlement date of new investors and prepares draft financial statements. NAV calculation and financial statements are approved by the Board of Directors.

      "ALPHA QUEST FUNDS SICAV p.l.c.  18 SPECIFIC DISCLOSURES (CONTINUED)  Risk factors and uncertainties that could negatively affect issuer’s business include but are not limited to:  -  Risk of newly formed company: The Company does not have long enough history to show proven track record.  -  Sub-funds being economically separated entities: The assets of other sub-funds cannot be used to satisfy obligations of other sub-funds. Thus only the assets of the sub-fund issuing financial obligation can be used to repay such obligation.  -  Payment titles issued by Romanian government: The major part of the sub-fund’s portfolio is invested in obligations issued by the Romanian state. This instrument is not publicly traded thus it is uncertain if it can be sold at a fair price at any time in the market place. The Fund’s investments in the points awarded under indemnification decisions issued by the Romanian Government need to be sourced from individual beneficiaries of such points and acquired through public deeds registered in Romania. There is no guarantee that the sub-Fund will manage to source such points, or a particular number of points. The sub-Fund may also be exposed to changes in the Romanian Government’s interpretation of the points system and/or to changes in the applicable laws.  -  Specific risks when investing in Romania: Although Romania is a full member of the European Union, it is still susceptible to a shaky political and economic outlook and a relatively volatile business environment in which corporate financial information is sometimes neither readily available nor sufficiently reliable. Following the collapse of communist rule in 1989, Romania has undergone a long period of economic transition to a market economy, which has not been smooth. Since 2000, there has been more progress. An extensive programme of economic reforms included the privatisation of several state-owned enterprises and the restructuring of Romania’s energy, mining and industrial sector. Externally, a slowdown in global trade may have a high impact on Romania’s growth, mainly due to its reliance on other EU economies as trading partners. Geopolitical tensions, combined with the increase in the US Federal Reserve’s key-interest rate could lead to increased investor caution, capital outflows and depreciation of the local currency (RON).  -  Market risk: Most of the assets of the sub-funds are invested in Romania which is considered an emerging market.  -  Sub-fund’s assets not being publicly traded: The Sub-funds invest in the Romanian instruments  which are not publicly traded.  Such instruments are considered risky and speculative in nature.  -  Interest rates changing risk: Fixed income instruments, which can be bought as an investment by the sub-funds, have an inverse relationship with changing interest rates. Unstable interest rates environment could have a negative impact on the fixed income instruments held by the sub-funds. If the level of market interest rates rises, the prices of interest-bearing securities in the Fund’s portfolio can fall substantially. This is even more the case, if the Fund holds interest-bearing securities having a longer residual term to maturity with normal return/yield.  -  Liquidity risk: Since the Romanian obligations are not publicly traded, it might be hard to sell should the Romanian government start defaulting on its obligations.   -  High leverage risk: Since Alpha Quest Balanced Fund is an issuer of publicly traded bonds, it is exposing itself to enormous amount of risk should its investment strategy produce negative returns.  \n",
      "ALPHA QUEST FUNDS SICAV p.l.c.  19 SPECIFIC DISCLOSURES (CONTINUED)  Risk factors and uncertainties that could negatively affect issuer’s business include but are not limited to: (continued)  -  Inflationary risk: Rising prices can affect the value of the underlying assets of the portfolio.  -  Foreign exchange risk: The functional currency of the Company and its sub-funds is the EUR while the assets of the portfolio are denominated mainly in RON. Where the Fund holds assets denominated in foreign currency or currencies, it is exposed to a direct currency risk (provided the foreign currency positions have not been hedged). In case of RON depreciation, this will have negative effect on the underlying net asset value of the sub-funds. Conversely, the foreign exchange market also offers opportunities for gains. Besides direct risks, indirect currency risks also exist. Internationally active companies are more or less strongly dependent on the exchange rate development, which can have an indirect influence on the price development of investments.  -  Concentration risk: The majority of fund’s assets are invested in the Romanian restitution points. This creates a risk for the underlying net assets value should the Romanian government default on its obligations.  -  Management compensation: Management have variable compensation based on the performance of the sub-funds. This can incentivize them to undertake speculative investments in order to produce extraordinary returns.  -  Operating risk: It can be created in the absence of rigorous internal processes.  -  Company founded under different law: The Company and its sub-funds have been incorporated under the laws of Malta. Maltese law can substantially differ from Czech laws and Slovak laws under which the publicly traded bonds of one of the sub-funds have been issued.  -  Political, economic and social risks: Romania is classified as an emerging and post-socialist market, which up to this date faced significant political, economic and social risk which could negatively impact the sub-funds’ performance and their net asset value.   Comparison with the corresponding period of the preceding year  Cashing in process has started in 2017, thus 1H 2017 was the first accounting period during which the Company has received actual payment titles for cashing in.  Comparing 2020 and 2021, the Company was in line with its objectives, receipt of payment titles was on expected track. The cashing in process has taken place prior to the 180 day period from issuance of payment titles.  During the year  2021, total amount of money cashed in from Romanian government was of RON 111,223,520  (2020: RON 106,466,564) for  Balanced Fund and RON 32,822,263  (2020:  RON 41,432,564) for Opportunity Fund.

Information about the Company's total assets and financial situation as at 31 December 2021 can be found in the Statement of Financial Position in the financial statements which form part of the Annual Report.  Evaluation of the business environment during reporting year 2021 Both sub-Funds performed very well and in line with Investment Committees’ expectations, mainly due to the fact the payments from the Romanian Government are on track and on time. Both sub-Funds received the expected 20% of the nominal value of all points held well ahead of the due date. Performance of both sub-Funds was further boosted by the leverage that the Balanced Fund currently has. Both sub-Funds also gained by investing free liquidity in corporate bonds. \n",

      "ALPHA QUEST FUNDS SICAV p.l.c.  Notes to the Financial Statements For year ended 31 December 2021  35  1  Reporting entity  Alpha Quest Funds SICAV p.l.c. (the “Company”) is organized under the laws of Malta as an investment company with variable share capital (SICAV) incorporated in accordance with the terms of the Companies Act, 1995 (Chapter 386, Laws of Malta) on 28 November 2016, with registration number SV 430. The Company is licensed and regulated by the Malta Financial Services Authority (“MFSA”) under the Investment Services Act (Chapter 370, Laws of Malta) as a Professional Investor Fund which targets Qualifying Investors as set out in the relevant Offering Supplement.  In April 2022, the Company submitted an application to the Malta Financial Services Authority to convert its license into an Alternative Investment Fund. When this application is accepted, the Company will need to implement a number of structural changes needed to comply with the new license conditions.  As at reporting date, the Company has constituted two sub-funds, the Alpha Quest Balanced Fund and the Alpha Quest Opportunity Fund (the “Sub-funds”), which were both licensed on 30 November 2016. The Sub-funds are not separate legal entities. Alpha Quest Balanced Fund has issued bonds (see note 13) which are listed on the Prague Stock Exchange and on the Bratislava Stock Exchange. The Company is the reporting entity and comprises all the activities of Alpha Quest Fund SICAV p.l.c. as the entity with the separate legal personality. The Statutory Financial Statements are those presented for the Company. The sub-funds are an integral part of that entity, as these do not have separate legal personality. In accordance with prevalent local practice, segregated financial information relating to amounts ‘attributable to the founder shareholders’ and to amounts ‘attributable to shareholders of the investor shares’ (segregated by the specific sub-fund) are disclosed following each primary financial statement, as applicable, and these form an integral part of the notes to the financial statements.  Also, in accordance with local practice, where appropriate, other disclosures in the notes in the financial statements are segregated by sub-fund. The inclusion of such financial information is nonetheless not a statutory requirement.  2  Basis of preparation  2.1  Statement of compliance  These financial statements have been prepared and presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union (“EU”) (the “applicable framework”). All references in these financial statements to IAS, IFRS or SIC/IFRIC interpretations refer to those adopted by the EU.  These  financial statements have also been prepared and presented in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, 1995 (Chapter 386, Laws of Malta).  2.2  Basis of measurement  The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss, which are measured at their fair value.  2.3  Functional and presentation currency   The financial statements are presented in Euro (EUR), which is the functional currency of the Company, rounded to the nearest unit.  ‘Functional currency’ is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates. If indicators of the primary economic environment are mixed, then the directors use its judgement to determine the functional currency that most faithfully represents the economic effect of the underlying transactions, events and conditions. The Company’s investments and transactions are denominated mainly in RON, CZK and EUR. Investor subscriptions and redemptions are determined based on net asset value, and received and paid in EUR.  The expenses are denominated and paid in CZK, RON  and EUR. Accordingly, the directors have determined that the functional currency of the Company is EUR.  2.4  Use of assumptions, estimates and judgements  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the directors to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect both the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimate was revised if the revision affects only that year or in the year of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.  In the opinion of the Directors, the accounting estimates and judgements made in the course of preparing these financial statements are not difficult to reach, subjective or complex to a degree which would warrant their description as critical in terms of the requirements of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.   2.5  New standards and interpretations not yet adopted  The Company did not early adopt new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations which are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2021. None of these are expected to have a significant effect on the financial statements of the Company in the period of initial application.\n",
      "ALPHA QUEST FUNDS SICAV p.l.c.  Notes to the Financial Statements For year ended 31 December 2021  36  3  Significant accounting policies   The  Company  has consistenly applied the accounting policies as set out below to all periods presented in these financial statements.   3.1  Foreign currency transactions  Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at the spot exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the spot exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency that are measured at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at the spot exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income.   3.2  Interest income and interest expense  Interest income comprises interest income on debt instruments. Interest expense comprises interest expense on borrowings. Interest income and interest expense  are  recognized as they  accrue in profit or loss, using the effective interest method.   3.3  Fees and commission expenses  Fees and commission expenses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as the related services are performed.  3.4  Restitution points  Restitution points arise from a statutory right in Romania (as further explained in note 12) and consequently, are not considered to be a financial asset under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation. These points do not fall within the scope of any specific IFRS. The directors performed a reassessment of the restitution points under the EU adopted IFRS framework and concluded that such an asset would not pass the SPPI test under IFRS 9 in view of the existence of a potential option which would allow the Company to opt for the application of the full par amount of the Restitution Points to auction for property in lieu of cash. Following their reassessment, the directors are of the view that IAS 16 provides specific guidance on compensation for the impairment of property, plant and equipment. On the premise that a loss event that creates a right for the Company to assert a claim has occurred, the entity recognises a receivable for the compensation when it has an unconditional contractual right to receive the compensation, in this case through holding the Restitution Points. Under this classification, the initial and subsequent measurement of the Restitution Points remain unchanged. The Company, therefore, continues to account for the restitution points as follows: On acquisition, the restitution points are recognised at the fair value of the consideration transferred, being the cash compensation paid to the transferor.  Subsequently, these are measured at amortised cost based on the discounted future cash flows expected to arise from the redemption of the Restitution Points, on the basis that the Company will enjoy the economic benefits from these assets by way of redeeming them through forward claims against the Romanian State (compensated in cash, over a period of five years, in equal tranches of 20% of the total number of points it owns). In addition, the Company’s potential benefit from exercising the option to auction for property is treated as a contingent gain in accordance with IAS 37.   3.5  Financial assets and financial liabilities  3.5.1  Recognition and initial measurement  The Company initially recognises financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) on the trade date, which is the date on which the Company  becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Other financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the date on which they are originated. A financial asset or financial liability is measured initially at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue.  3.5.2  Classification and subsequent measurement  On initial recognition, the Company classifies financial assets as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL.  A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:  -  it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and  -  its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.   All other financial assets of the Company are measured at FVTPL.   \n",
      "ALPHA QUEST FUNDS SICAV p.l.c.  Notes to the Financial Statements For year ended 31 December 2021  37  3  Significant accounting policies (continued)  3.5  Financial assets and financial liabilities (continued)  3.5.2  Classification and subsequent measurement (continued)   Business model assessment In making an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held, the Company considers all of the relevant information about how the business is managed, including:  -  the documented investment strategy and the execution of this strategy in practice. This includes whether the investment strategy focuses on earning contractual interest income, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of any related liabilities or expected cash outflows or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets; -  how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Company’s management; -  the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and how those risks are managed; -  how the investment manager is compensated: e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected; and -  the frequency, volume  and timing of sales of financial assets in prior years, the reasons for such sales and expectations about future sales activity. Transfers of financial assets to third parties in transactions that do not qualify for derecognition are not considered sales for this purpose, consistent with the Company’s continuing recognition of the assets.  The Company has determined that it has two business models: -  Held-to-collect business model: this includes cash and cash equivalents, and other financial assets. These other financial assets are held to collect contractual cash flows.   -  Other business model: this includes debt securities and investments in unlisted open-ended investment funds and derivatives. These financial assets are managed and their performance is evaluated, on a fair value basis, with frequent sales taking place.   Assessment whether contractual cash flows are SPPI   For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as a profit margin. In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are SPPI, the Company  considers the contractual  terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making this assessment, the Company considers: -  contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows; -  leverage features; -  prepayment and extension features; -  terms that limit the Company’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse features); and -  features that modify consideration of the time value of money (e.g. periodical reset of interest rates).    Reclassifications  Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Company were to change its business model for managing financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets would be reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in the business model.  Classification and subsequent measurement  The Company classified financial assets into the following categories.  -  Financial assets at FVTPL  Designated as at FVTPL: equity securities, debt securities and mutual funds  -  Financial assets at amortised cost:  Loans and receivables: cash and cash equivalents and receivables.   The Company designated all debt investments as at FVTPL on initial recognition because it managed these securities on a fair value basis in accordance with its documented investment strategy. Internal reporting and performance measurement of these securities were on a fair value basis.     Financial liabilities – Classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses  Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL.   A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition. \n",

Notes to the Financial Statements For year ended 31 December 2021  38  3  Significant accounting policies (continued)  3.5  Financial assets and financial liabilities (continued)  3.5.2  Classification and subsequent measurement (continued)   Financial liabilities – Classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses (continued) Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognised in profit or loss.  Financial liabilities measured  at amortised cost  includes  Bonds  issued  and  Other liabilities consisting of Other payables.  3.5.3  Fair value measurement  ‘Fair value’ is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its  absence, the most advantageous market to which the Company has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk.  When available, the Company measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset  or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an  ongoing basis. The Company  measures instruments quoted in an active market at a mid-price, because this price provides a reasonable approximation of the exit price.  If there is no quoted price in an active market, then the Company uses valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. The  chosen valuation technique incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction. The Company recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.  3.5.4  Amortised cost measurement  The ‘amortised cost’ of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any loss allowance.  3.5.5   Impairment    The Company recognises loss allowances for ECLs on financial assets measured at amortised cost.  The Company measures loss allowances at 12-month ECLs: -  financial assets that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; and -  other financial assets for which credit risk (i.e. the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the asset) has not increased significantly since initial recognition.  When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Company considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Company’s historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward-looking information.  The Company assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 30 days past due.  The Company considers a financial asset to be in default when: -  the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Company in full, without recourse by the Company to actions such as realising security (if any is held); or -  the financial asset is more than 90 days past due.  The Company considers a financial asset to have low credit risk when the credit rating of the counterparty is equivalent to the globally understood definition of ‘investment grade’. The Company considers this to be Baa3 by Moody’s.  12-month ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months).  The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Company is exposed to credit risk.  \n",
      "ALPHA QUEST FUNDS SICAV p.l.c.  Notes to the Financial Statements For year ended 31 December 2021  39  3  Significant accounting policies (continued)  3.5  Financial assets and financial liabilities (continued)  3.5.5   Impairment (continued)  Measurement of ECLs  ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive).   ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.    Presentation of allowance for ECLs in the statement of financial position  Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets.  Write-off  The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Company has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof.  3.5.6  Derecognition  The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Company  neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain control of the financial asset.  On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset that is derecognised) and the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) is recognised in profit or loss. Any interest in such transferred financial assets that is created or retained by the Company is recognised as a separate asset or liability.  The Company enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised on its statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets or a portion of them. If all or substantially all of the risks and rewards are retained, then the transferred assets are not derecognised. Transfers of assets with retention of all or substantially all of the risks and rewards include sale and repurchase transactions.  The Company derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in profit or loss.  3.5.7  Net gain/loss from financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss  Net gain/loss from financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss includes all realised and unrealised fair value changes and foreign exchange differences.   Net realised gain/loss from financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss is calculated using the average cost method.  3.5.8  Offsetting  Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Company has currently a legally enforceable right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.   Income and expenses are presented on a net basis for gains and losses from financial instruments at FVTPL and foreign exchange gains and losses.   3.6  Redeemable shares  The Company classifies financial instruments issued as financial liabilities or equity instruments in accordance with the substance of the contractual terms of the instruments. The Sub-funds issue redeemable shares on every dealing day defined as 31 December of each year, which are redeemable at the holder's option on every dealing day as defined above. Such shares are classified as financial liabilities. Redeemable shares can be put back to the Sub-funds at any time for cash equal to a proportionate share of the Sub-funds’ net asset value attributable to the share class. The redeemable shares are carried at the redemption amount that is payable at the statement of financial position date if the holder exercises the right to put the share back to the Sub-funds.   \n",
      "ALPHA QUEST FUNDS SICAV p.l.c.  Notes to the Financial Statements For year ended 31 December 2021  40  3  Significant accounting policies (continued)  3.6  Redeemable shares (continued)  Redeemable shares are issued and redeemed at the holder's option at prices based on the Sub-funds’ net asset value per share at the time of issue or redemption. The Sub-funds’ net asset value per share is calculated by dividing the net assets attributable to the holders of each redeemable share with the total number of outstanding redeemable shares. In accordance with the provisions of the Sub-funds’ regulations, investment positions are valued annually on 31 December based on the latest available dealing price for the purpose of determining the net asset value per share for subscriptions and redemptions.  3.7  Taxation   In terms of current Maltese fiscal legislation, collective investment schemes are classified as either `prescribed' or `non-prescribed' funds for income tax purposes. A collective investment scheme which declares that the value of its assets situated in Malta is less than eighty-five per cent of the value of its total assets is treated as a non-prescribed fund. On this basis, the Company qualifies as a non-prescribed fund for Maltese income tax purposes. Accordingly, the Company should not be subject to Maltese income tax in respect of the income or gain derived by it, except in respect of any income from immovable property situated in Malta, if any. Capital gains, dividends, interest and any other income from foreign investments held by  the  Company  may  nonetheless  be  subject  to  tax  imposed  by  the country of  origin concerned and any such taxes may not be recoverable by the Company or by the members under Maltese domestic tax law. The sub-funds are not a legal personality, so taxation is applied on the Company, which includes also the sub-funds.  Members resident in Malta  Capital gains  realised  by Maltese  resident  investors on  the redemption, liquidation or cancellation of units may be subject to a 15% withholding tax. However, the Maltese resident investors may request the Company not to effect the deduction of the said 15% withholding tax in which case the investor would be required to declare the gains in his income tax return and will be subject to tax at the normal rates of taxes.  Members not resident in Malta  Any gains accruing to members not resident in Malta upon the transfer of shares (including a redemption) or upon a distribution on a winding-up of the Company should not be subject to tax in Malta subject to certain conditions being satisfied. The transfer of shares (including a redemption) and any distribution on a winding-up of the Company may result in a tax liability for the non-Maltese members according to the tax regime applicable in their respective countries of incorporation, establishment, residence, citizenship, nationality, domicile, or other relevant jurisdiction.  3.8  Segment reporting  The disclosure of segment information is required by those entities whose debt or equity instruments are traded in a public market or that file, or are in the process of filing, their financial statements with a securities commission or other regulatory organisation for the purpose of issuing any class of instruments in a public market.   None of the units are listed. Transactions in all units are executed via the transfer agent and the transfer value of executed transactions is determined in accordance with the relevant prospectus of each sub-fund and is based on the net assets per unit at each valuation date. On the other hand, the Company has debt instruments listed on the Prague and Bratislava Stock Exchanges.    The operations conducted by the sub-funds of the Company are driven by the acquisition of restitution points as described in note 12. As a result, the directors determined that whilst there are two sub-funds, for which segregated financial information is provided in these financial statements, the operations nonetheless constitute a single segment. Accordingly, no further disclosures are required to comply with IFRS 8 Operating Segments.  4  Format of the financial statements  In terms of Section 3(3) of the Third Schedule of the Companies Act, 1995 (Chapter 386, Laws of Malta), the layout, nomenclature and terminology of the items in these audited financial statements were adapted to the special nature of the Company. The profit and loss is referred to as the Statement of Comprehensive Income.  5  Cash and cash equivalents   Cash and cash equivalents as disclosed in the Statement of Cash Flows comprise cash at bank and bank overdraft as follows:  In EUR 31.12.2021 31.12.2020 Founder shareholders  2,107,725 1,173,906 Alpha Quest Balanced Fund 2,412,066 1,645,320 Alpha Quest Opportunity Fund – Cash at Bank 2,495,127 349,583  The Company 7,014,918 3,168,809 \n",

The type of financial instruments in which the Company may invest is regulated by its Offering Memorandum and Offering Supplements investments restrictions.  The Company is an investment vehicle designed to specifically achieve different investment objectives through its sub-funds.   \n",
      "ALPHA QUEST FUNDS SICAV p.l.c.  Notes to the Financial Statements For year ended 31 December 2021  44  9  Financial Risk Review (continued)  Investment objective  The investment objective of both Sub-Funds is to achieve capital appreciation primarily through investments in points representing entitlement to immovable property located in Romania with the purpose of redeeming the points so acquired into cash or re-selling the immovable property so acquired. Such investments are derived from indemnification decisions issued by the Romanian Government –  National Commission for Real Estate Indemnifications, based on Law no. 165/2013 (“the Romanian Law”) regarding the measures for the completion of the restitution process, in kind or in equivalent, of the properties unlawfully seized during the Romanian communist regime, as subsequently amended.  The Romanian law provides that where restitution in kind to the former owners is not possible, the restitution request is settled by granting compensation in the form of points (hereinafter “Points”), with each point having a value of one Romanian Leu (RON 1). Starting from 1 January 2017, persons obtaining such points may use them in order to acquire immovable property from a National Fund by public auction or, for a period of five (5) years, to redeem  them into cash up to a maximum of 20% of the nominal value of Points per annum. There is no time-limit for utilizing Points to acquire immovable property by public auction. The Points may be acquired on the secondary market from existing owners through a notarial deed executed and registered in Romania.  If Points are redeemed at public auctions, the Sub-fund (through the Company) will not enter into any co-ownership deal and  will  only  acquire  individual  properties  in  their  entirety. Nonetheless, the objective of the sub-funds is to redeem points for cash. No Points will be acquired from any of the members of the Investment Committee and/ or any related parties to the Company.  The Sub-funds may also invest in government and corporate bonds in developed markets. The Sub-funds (through the Company) may also enter into agreements with third party banks that desire to issue fixed income products linked to the Sub-fund’s underlying assets and issue fixed income securities. The Sub-funds may from time to time invest unutilized cash in bonds and currency swaps. Such investments may be with various entities in various markets or industries and in different geographical locations, without limitation. Depending on market conditions, the Sub-fund may also from time to time invest in cash or money market instruments for liquidity purposes.  The Sub-funds are also exposed to market, credit and liquidity risks. This note presents information about the sub-fund’s  exposure  to  these  risks,  the  objectives,  policies  and  process  for  measuring  and  managing  risk  and  the Company’s  management  of  capital.  Further  quantitative  disclosures  are  included  throughout  these  financial statements.  9.1  Market risk  Market risk arises when changes in foreign exchange rates or equity prices affect the positions held by the Company. The Company does not regard either interest rate or commodity risks as material in its case. The Company invests neither in securities that exhibit direct interest rate sensitivity nor in commodities.  Price risk  Price risk  is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of the changes in market prices (other than those arising from interest rate risk or foreign currency risk), whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the individual instrument or its issuer, or factors affecting financial instruments traded in the market. All securities present a risk of loss of capital.  The sub-funds are not exposed to market price risk arising from their investments in the Romanian restitution points. The sub-funds invest in restitution points which are not subject to price risk. The sub-funds also hold investments in debt securities  and  Alpha Quest Opportunity Fund held an investment in a  collective investment scheme  in the comparative year, which was exposed to price risk.  As at 31 December 2021, the fair value of the Bonds and Fund Investments exposed to price risk were as follows:   Attributable to unitholders of investor shares of:   Attributable to unitholders of investor shares of:  Alpha Quest Balanced Fund Alpha Quest Opportunity Fund  Alpha Quest Balanced Fund Alpha Quest Opportunity Fund  2021 2021  2020 2020  EUR EUR  EUR EUR Debt securities 27,576,990 11,906,423  7,739,261 8,775,703 Equity securities 2,690,877 -  - - Collective investment scheme - -  - 1,191,870  30,267,867 11,906,423  7,739,261 9,967,573  \n",

It arises principally from debt securities held, loans receivable, cash and cash equivalents and other receivables. For risk management reporting purposes, the Company considers and aggregates all elements of credit risk exposure (such as individual obligor default risk, country risk and sector risk).  The Company’s policy over credit risk is largely concentrated within the Government of Romania which is perceived as having a low risk of default. Credit risk is monitored on a quarterly basis by the Board of Directors and Investment Committee in accordance with the policies and procedures in place. The  Company’s activities may give rise to settlement risk. ‘Settlement risk’ is the risk of loss due to the failure of a counterparty’s ability to honour its obligations to deliver cash as contractually and legally agreed upon.  Restitution points   The Company is the holder of uncontested and liquid claims against the Romanian State, in the amounts expressly provided within the Restitution Certificates and Decisions of Compensation. The Romanian law establishes deadlines for local entities to approve or reject claims for compensation. The legislation also establishes penalties for violation of the legislation including failure to meet compensation deadlines.  The  Company  monitors on a regular basis amendments on the legislation governing the compensation process.  Cash and cash equivalents   The cash and cash equivalents of the Company are held with J&T Banka and Banca Comerciala Romana S.A. The bank accounts with Raiffeisen Romania Bank were closed on 30 June 2021. The credit ratings for Banca Comerciala Romana S.A. are Baa1 by Moody’s whereas J&T Banka is not rated by a credit rating agency.   Debt securities held  The debt securities held by the sub-Funds, including those held in Alpha Quest Balanced Fund, are all unrated. \n",

Notes to the Financial Statements For year ended 31 December 2021  47  9  Financial Risk Review (continued)  9.2  Credit risk (continued)  9.2.1  Amounts arising from ECL and Recoverability of receivables under restitution points  Impairment on cash and cash equivalents and related party balances have been measured on a 12-month expected loss basis and reflects the short maturities of the exposures. The Company considers that these exposures have low credit risk based on the external credit ratings and/or financial positions of the counterparties.   The Company monitors changes in credit risk on these exposures by tracking published external credit ratings of the counterparties. As at 31 December 2020, the Company  did not recognise an impairment allowance nor did this condition change during the year ended 31 December 2021.  As such impairment was considered to be immaterial.  The Company acquires Restitution points at a discount and values the asset at amortised cost. The Board of Directors monitors each and every contract with the Romanian Government to ensure that the 20% annual restitution is paid on time. To this date, all restitution points have been received on and when due, and successfully cashed by the Company. The Company continues to consider the Government of Romania as having “extremely low credit risk” at the reporting date of these financial statements.  9.3  Liquidity risk   Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.   The Company’s liquidity position is monitored on a regular basis. Redeemable shares are redeemed on demand at the holder’s option provided that the redemption request is received by the respective Sub-fund three business days before the relevant dealing day, and if accepted by the Company, they will be dealt on every dealing day which is defined as 31 December of each year.   The Directors may limit the total number of the Investor shares which may be redeemed on any dealing day to 10% of the outstanding Investor shares in a particular sub-Fund. In the event that such a limit is reached at any point during a dealing day, the directors may defer any further redemption instructions received during that dealing day, to such time as the total number of redemption applications received on that dealing day is re-established at less than 10% of the outstanding Investor Shares in the particular sub-Fund.  The balance of such Investor Shares that are not redeemed on that  dealing day because of the limit established above will be redeemed on the next dealing day, subject to the directors’ same power of deferral until the orignal redemption instructions have been satisfied. Redemption requests which are deferred to the following dealing day will be given priority over any redemption requests received in relation to the said dealing day.  Alpha Quest Balanced Fund  On 22 December 2016, the Sub-Fund offered on the Prague Stock Exchange a private placement bond of CZK 500 million. In 2016, the sub-Fund issued CZK 460 million. On 27 December 2017, the Sub-Fund further offered and issued CZK 340 million bonds. On 8 January 2018, the Sub-Fund further offered and issued CZK 200 million bonds. These bonds were unsecured, their maturity date was on 22 December 2021 and had fixed annual coupons of 4.5%.   The Sub-Fund offered on the Bratislava Stock Exchange a private placement bond of EUR 40,000,000 (2020: EUR 6,223,000). The bond is unsecured, its maturity date is on 15 December 2025 and has fixed annual coupon of 5%.   During the current year, the Sub-fund also offered on the Prague Stock Exchange an unsecured Bond with maturity date on 22 June 2026 with a yield of 5.25% p.a. in the nominal value of CZK 200,000,000 (2020: CZK Nil).   The Sub-Fund is the owner of Romanian Restitution Certificates (“points”) issued by the Romanian State. In January 2017, Romania started the pay-out of the par value of points (1 point = 1 RON) in five annual payments (20% of the par value each year, i.e. 0.20 RON per point). Proceeds of the payments made by the State will be used to satisfy the coupon payments required to be made by the issuer.  Alpha Quest Opportunity Fund  Alpha Quest Opportunity is also the holder of restitution points. The sub-Fund’s liquidity position is monitored on a regular basis as mentioned in the above paragraph.  All other liabilities of the Company are due within less than one year.  10   Fair value information   Fair value hierarchy   The Company measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:  •  Level 1: Quoted market price (unadjusted) in an active market for an identical instrument. \n",

Being an investment of a sub-fund of the Company in another sub-fund of the Company, this investment was eliminated at Company level. This investment was sold during the current year. Realised and unrealised gains and losses related to this investment are also eliminated at Company level.   The debt securities consist of corporate bonds with coupon rates of 4.90% to 5.90% (2020: 4.50% to 5.00%) for Alpha Quest Balanced Fund and 4.40% to 6.50%  (2020:  0% to 5.00%)  for Alpha Quest Opportunity Fund. These  debt securities include the bonds issued by Alpha Quest Balanced Fund (refer to note 8). As required by IFRS 9.B3.3.2, the bonds payable are derecognised when the Company and the sub-Fund repurchases its own debt instruments previously issued, irrespective of whether the Company and the sub-Fund intends to resell those instruments to other parties in the near term.   12  Restitution points  The Restitution Certificates are the result of Law no. 165/2013 passed by the Romanian Parliament on April 2013, whereby it moves to compensation in the form of issuing points that can be used to purchase auctioned property confiscated during the Communist regime or redeemed for cash. The holder of the points must undergo a restitution process to exchange the points for the earmarked property or through a compensation process if restitution in kind is not possible.  The measurement basis chosen for the valuation of the Restitution Points held by the sub-funds was the discounted value approach, as this was deemed to be the only applicable approach given the characteristics of the assets and the sub-funds’ intention to enjoy the economic benefits from the assets by way of redeeming them through forward claims against the Romanian State which will be compensated in cash, over the next five years in equal tranches of 20% of the total number of points it owns. It was also assumed that such claims shall be made at the beginning  of  each  year,  no later than 1 February  of the respective year with cash received in 180  days  after  registering  the claim  with  the National Authority for Property Restitution (“ANRP”),  under  the  provisions  of  the Romanian Law.  To estimate the discounted value of the assets, the discounted cash flow method was applied. To derive the present value of the cash flows arising from the compensation of the points as mentioned above, it was considered that the appropriate discount rate should be the effective interest rate.  In addition, no asset has been recognised for the potential benefit arising from the possible option to auction for property as this is considered to be remote.  During the year, the sub-funds have invested in restitution points as stated below:  Alpha Quest Balanced fund Balances outstanding in this sub-fund are as below.   The nominal value of outstanding points as on 31 December 2021 is  RON  153,416,616 (equivalent to EUR 31,000,930) (2020: RON 189,703,140 (equivalent to EUR 38,967,820)). Cost of these points are RON 99,080,867 (equivalent to EUR 20,021,293) (2020: RON 121,852,824 (equivalent to EUR 25,030,365)).

Based on the assumptions and analysis mentioned above, the discounted value of the Restitution points of Alpha Quest Balanced Fund is estimated at RON 116,245,025 (2020: RON 146,206,148) and for Alpha Quest Opportunity Fund is estimated at  RON  24,068,400  (2020:  RON 47,558,714)  which  was  then  converted  into  Euro, the  base currency of the sub-Funds, applying the exchange rate as at reporting date.  \n",

Independent Auditors’ Report (continued)  To the Shareholders of Alpha Quest Funds SICAV p.l.c.  Key audit matters   Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period (selected from those communicated to the board of directors), and include a description of the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.  We summarise below the key audit matter, together with our response by way of the audit procedures we performed to address that matter in our audit, and key observations arising with respect to such risks of material misstatement.  Our audit approach to investments in restitution points  Accounting policy note 3.4 to the financial statements and note 12 for further disclosures  Restitution points (Current Assets: €11,731,057; Non-current Assets: €16,622,110).    The investments in restitution points, which represent points awarded by the National Authority for Property Restitution (an agency of the Government of Romania), is a significant proportion of the net asset value of the Company. We do not consider these investments to be subject to a high risk of material misstatement resulting from judgement, on the basis that the measurement of those points is not complex, and the redemption value of each point is fixed. Notwithstanding the lower risk of material misstatement, the procedures performed in relation to the investments in restitution points are considered of most significance in our audit, as these involved a significant audit effort.      \n",

Independent Auditors’ Report (continued)  To the Shareholders of Alpha Quest Funds SICAV p.l.c.  Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements  The directors are responsible for the preparation of financial statements that (a) give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, and (b) are properly prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Act, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.  The directors are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process.  Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements  Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud  or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion.  ‘Reasonable assurance’ is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.  As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.      \n",

Independent Auditors’ Report (continued)  To the Shareholders of Alpha Quest Funds SICAV p.l.c.  Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (continued)  We also:  •  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  •  Consider the extent of compliance with those laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements, as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items. For the remaining laws and regulations, we make enquiries of directors and other management, and inspect correspondence with the regulatory authority, as well as legal correspondence. As with fraud, there remains a higher risk of non-detection of other irregularities (whether or not these relate to an area of law directly related to the financial statements), as these may likewise involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.  •  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.    •  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.  •  Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.  Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.  \n",

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (continued)  •  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.  We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.  We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.  From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.      \n",

The period of uninterrupted engagement is five years; •  our opinion on our audit of the financial statements is consistent with the additional report required to be issued by the Audit Regulation (as referred to in the Act), and provided to the board of directors; and  •  we have not provided any of the prohibited services as set out in the APA.  Matters on which we are required to report by exception by the Act  Pursuant to articles 179(10) and 179(11) of the Act, we have nothing to report to you with respect to the following matters:  •  proper accounting records have not been kept; or  •  the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records; or  •  we have not obtained all the information and explanations which, to the best of our knowledge and belief, we require for the purpose of our audit.
